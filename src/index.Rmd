## Who This Review Is For {-}

The [RallyDataJunkie project](https://rallydatajunkie.com), such as it is, is a personal exploration of various ways of representing and visualising rally related stage, timing and results data.

There are several potential audiences:

- rally fans, looking for summaries of rally events;
- teams and crews, looking for variously arranged summaries to check and compare performances;
- commentators and journalists, looking for variously arranged summaries and overviews as a tool for confirming or identifying storypoints;
- data folk, looking for various ways of representing various route, timing or results data.
